              To evaluate a combination whose operator names a compound procedure, the
              interpreter follows much the same process as for combinations whose
              operators name primitive procedures, which we described in
              Section <REF NAME="sec:evaluating-combinations"/>.
              That is, the interpreter
              evaluates the elements of the combination and applies the procedure
              (which is the value of the operator of the combination) to the
              arguments (which are the values of the operands of the combination).

              Here, the interpreter
              evaluates all component expressions 
              of the application and applies the function
              (which is the value of

              We can assume that the mechanism for applying primitive procedures to
              arguments is built into the interpreter.  For compound procedures, the
              application process is as follows:
              <UL>
                <LI>
                  To apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of the

                </LI>

              Then we replace the formal parameter <SCHEMEINLINE>a</SCHEMEINLINE>

              The substitution model for function application can handle
              functions whose body consists of a single 
              <SCHEMEINLINE>return</SCHEMEINLINE> statement. All functions
              encountered so far follow this format, and most functions in
              this chapter can be easily converted into this format.
              For functions with this property,
              the process of function application proceeds as follows:

                  corresponding
                  argument.
                </LI>

                  The purpose of the substitution is to help us think about

                  to substitute values for the formal parameters.  In practice, the
                  <QUOTE>substitution</QUOTE> is accomplished by using a local environment for the
                  formal parameters.  We will discuss this more fully in chapters 3 and

                  Over the course of this book, we will present a sequence of
                  increasingly elaborate models of how interpreters work, culminating
                  with a complete implementation of an interpreter and compiler in
                  chapter<SPACE/>5.  The substitution model is only the first of these
                  models<EMDASH/>a way to get started thinking formally about the evaluation
                  process.  In general, when 
                  <INDEX>modeling<SUBINDEX>in science and engineering</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
                  modeling phenomena in science and
                  engineering, we begin with simplified, incomplete models.  As we
                  examine things in greater detail, these simple models become
                  inadequate and must be replaced by more refined models.  The
                  substitution model is no exception.  In particular, when we address in
                  Chapter<SPACE/>3 the use of 
                  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT>

                  with <QUOTE>mutable data,</QUOTE> we will see that
                  the substitution model breaks down and must be replaced by a more
                  complicated model of 
                  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT>

                  application.<FOOTNOTE>Despite the
                    simplicity of the substitution idea, it turns out to be surprisingly
                    complicated to give a rigorous mathematical definition of the
                    substitution process.  The problem arises from the possibility of
                    confusion between the names used for the formal parameters of a
                    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT>
                    </SPLITINLINE>

              According to the description of evaluation given in
              Section <REF NAME="sec:evaluating-combinations"/>, the interpreter first
              evaluates the operator and operands and then applies the resulting procedure
              to the resulting arguments.  This is not the only way to perform
              evaluation.  An alternative evaluation model would not evaluate the
              operands until their values were needed.  Instead it would first substitute
              operand expressions for parameters until
              it obtained an expression involving only primitive operators, and
              would then perform the evaluation.  If we used this method, the
              evaluation of

              This gives the same answer as our previous evaluation model, but the

              According to the description of evaluation given in
              Section <REF NAME="sec:evaluating-combinations"/>, the interpreter first
              evaluates the operator and operands and then applies the resulting 
              <CHANGE>function</CHANGE>
              to the resulting arguments.  This is not the only way to perform
              evaluation.  An alternative evaluation model would not evaluate the
              operands until their values were needed.  Instead it would first substitute
              operand expressions for parameters until
              it obtained an expression involving only primitive operators, and
              would then perform the evaluation.  If we used this method, the
              evaluation of
              <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
                <JAVASCRIPT>
f(5)
                </JAVASCRIPT>
              </SNIPPET>
              would proceed according to the sequence of expansions
              <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
                <JAVASCRIPT>
sum_of_squares(5 + 1, 5 * 2)

square(5 + 1)     + square(5 * 2)

(5 + 1) * (5 + 1) + (5 * 2) * (5 * 2)
                </JAVASCRIPT>
              </SNIPPET>
              followed by the reductions
              <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
                <JAVASCRIPT>
6       *    6    +   10    *   10

       36         +        100

                 136
                </JAVASCRIPT>
              </SNIPPET>
              This gives the same answer as our previous evaluation model, but the
              process is different.  In particular, the evaluations
              of <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>5 + 1</JAVASCRIPTINLINE> and 
              <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>5 * 2</JAVASCRIPTINLINE> are each performed twice here,
              corresponding to the reduction of the expression
              <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
                <JAVASCRIPT>
x * x
                </JAVASCRIPT>
              </SNIPPET>
              with <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>x</JAVASCRIPTINLINE> replaced respectively 
              by <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>5 + 1</JAVASCRIPTINLINE> 
              and <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>5 * 2</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>.

              Lisp uses applicative-order evaluation, partly because of the
              additional efficiency obtained from avoiding multiple evaluations of
              expressions such as those illustrated with <SCHEMEINLINE>(+ 5 1)</SCHEMEINLINE> 
              and <SCHEMEINLINE>(* 5 2)</SCHEMEINLINE> above and, more significantly, 
              because normal-order evaluation
              becomes much more complicated to deal with when we leave the realm of
              procedures that can be modeled by substitution.  On the other hand,
              normal-order evaluation can be an extremely valuable tool, and we will
              investigate some of its implications in Chapters 3 and 4.<FOOTNOTE>In

                interpreter to produce a normal-order variant of Scheme.</FOOTNOTE>
