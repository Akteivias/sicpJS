        The programs of the book are given in the original Scheme language.
	The Scheme programs can be executed (evaluated) by
    clicking on them. Clicking on the result or on "Play" 
    opens a new window that lets you play with the programs.
    There is also a version of the book 
    <LINK address="sicp_javascript.html">that uses Javascript</LINK>
    instead of Scheme, and a version 
    <LINK address="sicp_compare.html">that allows you to compare both</LINK>.
