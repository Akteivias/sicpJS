<NAME>JavaScript Adaptation Making-of</NAME>

<NAME>Background</NAME>

<TEXT>
  Like the Source Academy, the JavaScript adaptation of SICP is an open-source community effort.
  The software and data required for making these web pages and the PDF edition are contained
  in the repository <LINK address="https://github.com/source-academy/sicp">Source Academy / sicp</LINK>,
  and improvements, extensions and discussions are handled in this repository as with many other
  open-source software projects.

  Martin Henz started translating SICP to JavaScript in 2008. He obtained the original
  <LaTeX/><SPACE/>sources of the textbook from the Gerald Sussman, and converted it to an XML
  format that allowed
  him to retain the original sources along with the JavaScript adaptation in a single file.
  He developed a processing system to generate HTML from XML, using XSLT, resulting in the
  first version of the JavaScript adaptation.

<NAME>Mobile-friendly Web Edition</NAME>

<TEXT>
  The mobile-friendly web edition of SICP JS was designed and implemented by Liu Hang
  in 2017 and then further developed by Feng Piaopiao in 2018. Liu Hang decided to use Ruby on
  Rails for generating the HTML pages from the XML.  Formulas are rendered on-the-fly using MathJax. 
  The XML documents are processed using Nokogiri. For that, the website is originally
  hosted as a Ruby on Rails application and the generated HTML files are then collected as
  a pure-HTML5 website. Formulas are retained in the resulting HTML files
  and are type-set by the reader's browser on-the-fly, using the MATHJAX system.

In the textbook, program fragments often require other program fragments.
In order to collect and execute the necessary programs, the corresponding
<TT>SNIPPET</TT> tags in the xml files include <TT>REQUIRES</TT> tags. The Rails
server uses these tags in order to assemble the executable programs. The required
snippets are executed in the background when the program text is clicked and the
snippet is displayed in a popup box.
